-- LEAP YEAR
Detecting leap year from a user's input

A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

- on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder

- except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder

- unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

-- FOOD CLASSIFIER
All the code does is randomly set the food  variable to  
either 'apple','grape', 'bacon', 'steak', 'worm', or 'dirt'.    

If food is set to either 'apple' or 'grape', your code should print 'fruit'. 

If food is set to either 'bacon' or 'steak', your code should print 'meat' 

If food is set to either 'dirt' or 'worm' your code should print 'yuck'
