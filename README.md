Detecting leap year from a user's input

A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

- on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder

- except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder

- unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder
